# AMVC Website

### Created in 2 Hours on 6.8.21

This is just a website for the AMVC organization... it is just going to showcase a couple of screenshots and boast about things that AMVC really cant do. If you want to add to the website, feel free to commit to it or fork it. It is completely written in HTML/SASS and compiled into HTML/CSS using parcel. Please use parcel when editing the site and do not try and refactor the entire website.

To check out the site, just head over [here](https://amvc-gaming.github.io/).
